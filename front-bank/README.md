## üìù Initialization

To set up and initialize the cookbook, follow these steps:

1. **Generate Your Credentials**:

   - Go to the [Bitkub Chain Playground](https://playground.bitkubchain.com/) and generate your `clientID` and `projectID`.

2. **Configure Your SDK Cookbook**:
   - Insert your `clientID` and `projectID` into the `src/lib/bitkubchain-sdk.js` file.

Here‚Äôs an example:

```javascript
import { Network, initializeSDK } from '@bitkub-chain/sdk.js'

// Replace with your actual Client ID and Project ID
export const sdk = initializeSDK(
  'your-client-id', // Client ID from Bitkub Chain Playground
  'your-project-id', // Project ID from Bitkub Chain Playground
  Network.BKC_TESTNET,
)
```

3. Now you should be able to start the project! üöÄ
